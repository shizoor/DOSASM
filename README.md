80x50 and 80x25
</h1>
Back when using DOS thru 98, XP etc. one of the most annoying things was not being able to resize the DOS console or window.  This simply changes the video mode to 80x50 or 80x25 if the mode command isn't present or you can't do mode 80 for some reason.
Found info on forum posts, etc.
